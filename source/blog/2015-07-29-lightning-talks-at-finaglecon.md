[FinagleCon][finaglecon] is just over two weeks away, and we're looking for a
few attendees who are interested in giving lightning talks to kick off the
afternoon. The talks will be capped at five minutes and can be on a wide range
of Finagle-related topics: how you're using Finagle, suggested changes,
far-fetched experiments, integration with other libraries or tools, etc.

If you'd like to present a lightning talk,
[email us](mailto:finaglecon@twitter.com) a few sentences about your topic by
12 PM PDT next Wednesday (August 5); we'll be announcing the list of
speakers that afternoon. Please let us know if you have any questions about the
lightning talks, or about the conference more generallyâ€”we look forward to seeing
you there!
