The upcoming releases of our family of projects will be the final release for
Scala 2.10 and Java 7. These should be:

* Finagle 6.35.0
* Finatra 2.1.6
* Util 6.34.0
* Scrooge 4.7.0
* TwitterServer 1.20.0
* Ostrich 9.18.0

Java 7 reached its [end-of-life](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/eol-135779.html)
in April 2015 and we would like to begin using the Java 8 libraries as well as
remove some Java 7 specific workarounds. Once Scala 2.12 is released, we plan
to add support for cross-compiling Scala 2.11 and 2.12.

Note that the scrooge-sbt-plugin will continue to be published for only
Scala 2.10 due to sbt plugin requirements.

If important patch releases become necessary we will try to accomodate these
needs.
