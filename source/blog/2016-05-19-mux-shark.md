This [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) dissector provides basic decoding of all
[Mux](http://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Protocols.html#mux) messages including:

* Frame length
* Message type
* Tag number

or [Mux](http://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Protocols.html#mux)?
Follow the links for introductions.</sub>

While this was released as part of Finagle 6.33.0 we never got around to properly announcing it. Now that Shark Week 2016 is about a month away, it felt like a good time to tell people about it.

The ``Tdispatch`` messages include decoding of our common
[Contexts](http://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Contexts.html), destination,
and [Dtabs](http://twitter.github.io/finagle/guide/Names.html#interpreting-paths-with-delegation-tables).

See the
[README](https://github.com/twitter/finagle/blob/develop/finagle-mux/src/main/lua/README.md)
for installation and usage instructions.
