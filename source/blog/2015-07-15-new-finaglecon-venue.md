We're pleased to announce that this year's [FinagleCon][finaglecon] will now be
hosted at Twitter's new [One 10th Street Expansion][one-tenth] in San Francisco.
We believe that this location will be more convenient than the Kaiser Center in
Oakland for many attendees, and we're looking forward to showing off this brand
new space.

The One 10th Street Expansion is next door to Twitter HQ at 1355 Market Street,
and is easily accessible from the [Civic Center / UN Plaza BART station](http://www.bart.gov/stations/civc),
or by any of a number of [Muni bus routes](https://www.sfmta.com/) along Market
Street.

Parking is available at the [Fox Plaza Public Parking Garage][fox-plaza], the [Civic Center
Garage][civic-center], and several [other locations in the area][parking]. A limited number of public bicycle rack spaces are
available on Marketâ€”please [contact us](mailto:finaglecon@twitter.com) if you'd
like to arrange for secure bike parking.

Although we're no longer located at the same venue as the other
[Scala by the Bay](http://scala.bythebay.io/) events, FinagleCon is of course still
a part of the larger Scala by the Bay conference, and all Scala by the Bay attendees
receive free registration for FinagleCon.

We'll be getting started with breakfast at 8:30 AM on the morning of August 13
(stay tuned for the full program announcement tomorrow), and look forward to seeing you there!
